Need to intialize it first
acc = 0

Random Method:
numbers between 0 - 1
import random to execute.

String Data types
Len bulit in functions
Looking for input from the user
Simple cryptographic algorithms

String - a sequence of characters
Quote delimited
single '
double "
and triple "'

Concatination + - take two strings and put them together
Repetition * - repeats a string
index [i] - returns a character at position i, indexes start at 0
index[-1] - means you work backwards (negative indexes)
Slice [i:j] returns the substring from i to j - 1

String Methods:
center:
aString.center(w) 
returns the string aString evenly surrounded by spaces
count
returns the number of occurances
upper 
returns string in all uppercase
lower
returns string in all lowercase
find 
returns the first occurance of something in a string
rfind
returns the last occurance of something in a string

Character Functions
Convert between characters and numbers
ord gives you a unicode character in order to find its position
chr gives you which letter is in position
str changes numbers to strings

Cyptography
encoding and decoding messages
ciphertext - encoded version
plaintext - orginal version
encryption - create ciphertext
decryption - decoded message
